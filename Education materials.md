# Energy-meteorology education materials

## Prepared for the Next Generation Challenges in Energy Climate Modelling Workshop, 2021

### Lead by Hannah Bloomfield, Katharina Gruber and Jan Wohland, with support from the conference organizing committee

The global need to reverse the damage to the planet done by humans over multiple centuries is provoking a rapid change in the way we interact with the planet. One of the main challenges here is a change in how national energy systems operate. Generally these systems are attempting to reduce their reliance of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and natural gas), which release green-house gases including carbon dioxide. These green-house gases are very damaging to the planet, and a leading cause of global warming. Instead of using fossil fuels many nations are turning instead to renewable electricity generation, powered by natural resources such as wind, sunshine or water. This has led to the development of a new scientific discipline - energy meteorology!

When conducting research in this area (or just entering the topic with an interest to learn more) it is very rare to have equal levels of knowledge on both the energy and meteorology components of the subject. The following resources are therefore intended to help provide introductory material for both the fields of energy and meteorology and the combined field of energy-meteorology.

We have tried to limit these to bite-size information videos (~5 minutes). Some useful, but slightly longer online webinars or conference talks from energy-meteorologists are given in italics. Advanced materials and opportunities to download data and start your own research are given at the end of the document.

**Note**: The links to these external resources are provided on an ‘as is’ basis. While it is hoped that you may find the links useful when beginning to explore topics in energy-meteorology before and after the workshop, this document is not intended to be an exhaustive list or resources, nor does inclusion on the list necessarily imply an endorsement of the content.

## Opportunities to Download weather, climate and energy data.
There are loads of [time series of data](https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/t/freely-available-datasets-of-energy-variables/2291) available out there that you can download and start to play with. 

Or if for now you’d rather just look at some data here are some websites which allow you to explore climate and energy data:
TealTool: https://tealtool.earth/ This is the best starting point for visualising climate data relevant for energy systems modelling. TealTool is a free climate data tool designed to raise awareness about climate change.

You can look at national level weather data from across the globe and look at different timescales in ECEM demonstrator: http://ecem.wemcouncil.org/ This also shows weather data of a present and future climate. The difference from the TealTool is you can also look at energy variables (e.g. electricity demand, wind power, solar power and hydropower.) The ECEM demonstrator is limited to over Europe.

Raw climate data can be downloaded from the Copernicus Climate data store, there are instructions for how to use their python API https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu/

If you’re interested in creating your own seasonal forecasts' multi-model with Python and C3S the this could be useful: http://www.matteodefelice.name/post/c3s-multimodel/
